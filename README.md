### How to add new market üõí
There are 2 files you need to update:

1. Add new tokens or check the tokens exist (for example, for RIN/USDC tokens are RIN & USDC) on `src/tokens.json`

2. Add twitter, coinmarketcap/coingecko/nomics links to `src/tokens.json`

3. Add Serum market to `src/markets.json`

>**Note**
Please double-check all links (twitter, cmc, etc.), IDs and names for token and market. Please also check that the market and/or token does not already exist.
